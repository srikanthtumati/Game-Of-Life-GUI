Instructions
------------

1) Download the JavaFX 12.0.1 SDK from the following URL (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) with the SDK download depending on your operating system.

2) Unzip the downloaded file and ensure the unzipped directory is named 'javafx-sdk-12.0.1'.

3) Place the directory ('javafx-sdk-12.0.1') directly in the 'Sources Files' directory. Consequently, the 'Source Files' folder should contain two subfolders ('src' and 'javafx-sdk-12.0.1').

4) Execute run.sh.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If run.sh is not executable, move into the directory in which it is placed and run
the following command. 'chmod +x run.sh'
